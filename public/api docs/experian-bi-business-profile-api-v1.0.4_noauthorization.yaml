          Search Experian's UK Business database to return either the best matching business or a list of businesses to choose from. You can then use a returned identifier to request additional business information from many of Experian's Business Information APIs. <br/><br/>
          Searches can be made using:
          <ul>
          <li>the business name only</li>
          <li>the business postcode</li>
          <li>the business identifiers (registration number or Experian non limited key)</li>
          <li>additional filters to qualify the search scope (registered/non registered, dissolved businesses)</li>
          </ul>
        <br/>
        Sample searches against name=TEST will work in the Sandbox.
