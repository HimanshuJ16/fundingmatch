        This endpoint returns the Financial Strength Score (FSS) which rates the financial
        strength of a registered company and aims to predict insolvency over the following

        The score is based primarily on annual filed accounts so does not exist for
        non-registered entities. Companies who have not yet submitted a set of accounts
        are not likely to be scored.
